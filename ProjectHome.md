The discovery of peaks within large sequencing data sets is an integral process in the detection of interesting and significant genomic locations in next-generation sequencing projects. With more than fifty existing approaches available for peak calling, best practices suggest applying different identification techniques using various parameter settings to produce high quality results. Currently, no widely available ensemble is available that provides a means for peak discovery within aligned sequencing reads.

Here we present a peak calling ensemble, named Peak+, that selects tools appropriate for a user-specified experimental conditions using a categorization based on the taxonomic characterizations for the analytical approaches. The ensemble subsequently allows the submission and analysis of format-variable sequencing files to the approaches deemed suitable for the specified experimental conditions. Resulting peaks are furthermore characterized based on genomic partition and evolutionary conservation.
